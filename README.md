## Current Status
Iâ€™m in the early concept phase, focusing on the following aspects:
- **Mechanism Design**: Exploring micro-pumps and solenoid valves for precise injection control.
- **Microcontroller**: Considering **ESP32** for wireless control and scheduling the injections.
- **Medication Reservoir**: Designing a compact, refillable reservoir to store liquid medication.
- **Power Supply**: Researching low-power options to ensure long-term operation.

## Next Steps
1. **Component Selection**: Finalize the injection mechanism and choose sensors to monitor medication levels.
2. **Prototype Development**: Begin assembling an initial prototype with a focus on size, reliability, and functionality.
3. **Safety Features**: Incorporate fail-safes and dosage tracking to ensure patient safety.

## Future Ideas
- **Mobile App Integration**: Control and monitor the injector via smartphone for remote adjustments.
- **Wearable Design**: Develop a wearable version for patients who need frequent, on-the-go medication.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement predictive algorithms to optimize dosage timing based on patient data.
